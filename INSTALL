For now, all you have to do is to type

   $ ./configure
   $ make

it will build an OCaml toplevel with all necessary libraries linked
with the executable.

   $ make install

install the toplevel ocamlsdl in the directory $prefix/bin and all 
necessary libraries in the directory $prefix/lib/ocaml/sdl.
