OCamlSDL: An interface between OCaml and SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of OCamlSDL is to provide access the multimedia hardware
in the ML programming language with the help of the SDL library.
The Simple DirectMedia Layer is a generic API that provides low
level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, and display framebuffer across
multiple platforms. 

This ML interface might be used to prototype multimedia applications. 
As soon as possible, I will write some examples.
