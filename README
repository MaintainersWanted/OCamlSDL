OCamlSDL - An interface between OCaml and SDL

*Overview

The goal of OCamlSDL is to provide access the multimedia hardware
in the ML programming language with the help of the SDL library.
The Simple DirectMedia Layer is a generic API that provides low
level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, and display framebuffer across
multiple platforms. 

This ML interface might be used to prototype multimedia applications.
