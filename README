OCamlSDL - An interface between OCaml and SDL

*Overview

The goal of OCamlSDL is to provide access the multimedia hardware
in the ML programming language with the help of the SDL library.
The Simple DirectMedia Layer is a generic API that provides low

This ML interface might be used to prototype multimedia applications.
